msgid "col.name.audit.values has to be a single character value (default book.value)."
msgstr ""

msgid "col.name.riskweights has to be NULL if no risk weights are used (as in ordinary MUS) or a single character value (default NULL)."
msgstr ""

msgid "filled.sample needs to be a data frame or a matrix but it is not."
msgstr ""

msgid "The filled.sample requires a column with the book values and the name of this column has to be provided by parameter col.name.book.values during MUS.planning (default book.value)."

msgid "filled.sample must not have a column 'd' because this column name is used for internal evaluation."

msgid "filled.high.values needs to be a data frame or a matrix but it is not."

msgid "The filled.high.values requires a column with the book values and the name of this column has to be provided by parameter col.name.book.values during MUS.planning (default book.value)."

msgstr ""

msgid "You had at least 20 errors in the sample - some statistical software recommends High Error Rate evaluation instead of Low Error Rate evaluation in this case. However, High Error Rate evaluation is not yet implemented. The evaluation might not be appropriate."

msgid "seed has to be an integer value greater or equal than 0."

msgid "obey.n.as.min has to be TRUE or FALSE."
msgstr ""

msgid "start.point has to be a numeric value between 0 and possible recalculated interval length (both inclusive)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Parameters must be between 0 and 1."
msgstr ""

msgid "Data needs to be a data frame or a matrix but it is not."
msgstr ""

msgid "The data frame requires at least a column with the book values and the name of this column has to be provided by parameter col.name.book.values (default book.value)."
msgstr ""

msgid "There are missing or infinite values (NA, NaN or Inf) as book values in your data. Those elements have no chance for selection. You have to audit them separately."
msgstr ""

msgid "There are zeros as book values in your data. Those elements have no chance for selection. You have to audit them separately."
msgstr ""

msgid "There are negative values as book values in your data. Those elements have no chance for selection. You have to audit them separately."

msgid "Confidence level has to be a numeric value between 0 and 1 (both exclusive)."

msgid "Tolerable Error has to be a numeric value between 0 and book value (both exclusive)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Expected error has to be a numeric value greater or equal to 0."
msgstr ""

msgid "Minimum number of sample size has to be a numeric value between 0 and the number of items in the population (last exclusive). If the minimum sample size is equal or larger than the number of items in the population, sampling is not suitable because every item has to be tested anyway."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tolerable Error has to be a numeric value between 0 and book value (both exclusive). If the tolerable error is equal larger than book value, no sampling is necessary. However, Planning will be proceeded."
msgstr ""

msgid "Undefined situation: If 0 errors in the sample occur, the sample size needs to be positive!"
msgstr ""

msgid "MUS makes no sense for your sampling problem - your sample size needs to be bigger than the number of items in your population."
msgstr ""

msgid "Just for information: If the expected error is equal or larger than te tolerable error, MUS is not applicable."

msgid "n.optimal is not plausible (negative), internal error, please report as bug."

msgid "n.optimal is not plausible (smaller than lower bound ni), internal error, please report as bug."

msgid "n.optimal is not plausible (greater than upper bound nip1), internal error, please report as bug."
